- Automatically detect which files are in the themes directories to create symlinks. Or allow the user to manually list the paths to create the syminks on. The goal is to remove all the paths in the update_files() function.

- Make this a package somehow? For it to just be a command, and not have to create a shell function.

- Add verbose to tell the user which files have been replaces. Maybe optional, with a -v option.

- Make waybar restart seemless, nohup seems kind of awkward.

- Maye automatically detect directories in the Themes folder to remove the need to list them all in the config.

- Add a revert option to revert to last theme?
